Excuse me for a moment while I do a happy dance for effecting change.  It's a small victory, but...

  Mr. Mattice,
 
  Thank you for your comment.
  We acknowledge that the EMVCo tag definition is not fully ISO compliant.  For clarification We will remove the reference to ISO 8825 in the next version of the specifications.
 
  Sincerely,
  The EMVCo Secretariat (on behalf of L2WG)

I'm glad they've admitted to this.  I hope it makes someone else's job easier someday.
